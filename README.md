# Python classes Tutorial

## Introduction

Python is an object oriented programming language, with almost everything is an object, with its properties and methods.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

## Goal

Data Processing Script
This script processes input data, performs analysis, and outputs results.

## Let's Start

### Classes

We will start of my creating a class and understanding the difference between a class and a function in python.

Classes as defined above act like object, and Object is basically something that has a key and a value. eg:

````
```Objectvar = {
 'name': "mutuku",
 'age':30
}```
````

The above can then be accessed as shown below:

````
 ```Objectvar.name```
````

The result from the above should be:

````
 ```"mutuku"```
````

Classes unlike functions start with the keyword "class". eg:

````
 ``` class ClassName():```
````

while as we saw in our last session functions start with the keyword "def". eg:

````
 ```def FunctionName():```

````
