# Learning Python Progressively

## Introduction

This repository will contain everything you will need to learn to deal with data analysis activities on your own. It will be broken down to module so that you can understand everything well and clearly.

Firstly, this is a _README.md_ file this is necessary to understand the repository and mostly found in may git projects but not necessary in every case.

## Python Installation into local machine.

This will not be guided as I believe you know how to so we can skip this. Otherwise, ask if needed.

## Set up virtual environment while inside this folder.

When working on you python projects it is best to work inside a virtual enviroment that is if you have multiple project otherwise also skip this.

## Install necessary requirements

### IDE:

- Jupyter Notebook/Lab: Best for interactive data analysis and visualization.(Recommend)
- PyCharm: Best for a comprehensive and feature-rich development environment (especially the Professional version).
- VS Code: Best for a lightweight, customizable IDE with powerful extensions.
