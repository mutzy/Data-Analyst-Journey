# Learning Python Progressively

## Introduction

This repository will contain everything you will need to learn to deal with data analysis activities on your own. It will be broken down to module so that you can understand everything well and clearly.

Firstly, this is a _README.md_ file this is necessary to understand the repository and mostly found in may git projects but not necessary in every case.

## Python Installation into local machine.

This will not be guided as I believe you know how to so we can skip this. Otherwise, ask if needed.

## Set up virtual environment while inside this folder.

When working on you python projects it is best to work inside a virtual enviroment that is if you have multiple project otherwise also skip this.

## Install necessary requirements

### IDE:

- Jupyter Notebook/Lab: Best for interactive data analysis and visualization.(Recommend)
- PyCharm: Best for a comprehensive and feature-rich development environment (especially the Professional version).
- VS Code: Best for a lightweight, customizable IDE with powerful extensions.

## Nature of Lesson

We will use branches to divide the classes up when done we will move to the next that means you will git checkout to the required branch.
But to make the lesson include learning git / github you will include this in this lessons.

### Git commands

git clone https://github.com/{username}/{repo}.git - This command clones the github repository to your local machine. Or click just click download to download a zip file and extract the same.

git checkout {branchname} - This command allows you to switch branches

git branch {branchname} - This commmand creates a new branch

git merge {branchwherechangesare} {currentbranchname}

git commit -m "{Your commit message}" - This allows you to write a summary of what you have done before pushing to remote repository

git pull - This allows you to fetch and also commit updates from remote repo if you are working in a team

git push origin {branchname} - This allows you to push your changes to remote repository after committing you changes using.

# What you will learn when done.

1. Python Programming.
2. SQL querying.
3. R Programming.
4. Necessary Libraries Importing and Use.
5. Finally Use of Frameworks and Integrations to external platforms.
